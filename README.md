## Hi 👋 I'm Faqih

I’m a data engineering learner focused on building strong fundamentals and understanding how data systems work from the ground up.

---

### 🎯 Current Focus
- Python (core programming & problem solving)
- SQL (querying, joins, aggregations)
- Data fundamentals (data quality, structure, basic pipelines)

---

### 🧪 Mini Projects
- **Tic Tac Toe (Python)**  
  A simple console-based game built to practice control flow, functions, and basic game logic.

---

### 🧭 Learning Approach
- Prioritizing fundamentals over tools
- Writing small, focused projects to reinforce concepts
- Documenting progress through code and notes
